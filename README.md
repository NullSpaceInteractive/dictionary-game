# Dictionary-Game

This project was made with the [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) framework for the 2021 'Rona Round-Up.

## Installation

Dictionary-Game can be run locally by downloading the source and running `yarn` from a
terminal followed by `yarn start`.

This will run a local development server at `localhost:4000` where you can either play the game or edit the source code
and see the changes reflected after a short time.


## About
The objective is to guess the word when given only its definition which can be quite challenging!

The game is quite difficult because it does not accept synonyms, so choose wisely when guessing.

The words are obtained from a list compiled from [this](https://github.com/aaronbassett/Pass-phrase) repo and
definitions are obtained from the https://dictionaryapi.dev/ API
